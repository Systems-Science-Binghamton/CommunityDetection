    "So why does the modularity high even for random networks, where communities do not exist. It's because we *maximize* the modularity. The modularity maximization partition nodes into an exclusive set of nodes. And there are an exponential number of possible partitions of nodes. Most partitions have a small modularity. But,  in one of the countless number of possible partitions, many edges appear within each group by a random chance. And the algorithm picks this partition with the highest (or nearly highest) modularity. "
